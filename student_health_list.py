def student_health_list(datafile, healthiness: int) -> list:
    """
    Given the data sheet name and a value of how healthy the student is from 1 to 5, returns the files of all students with that level of health as a list of dictionaries, excluding the health value. If the health value is not in the file, returns an empty list

    Preconditions: data file named 'student-mat.csv'

    Examples:

    >>> student_health_list('student-mat.csv', 2)
    [ {'School': 'MS', 'Age': 20, 'StudyTime': 1.2, 'Failures': 1, 'Absences': 10,
     'G1': 9, 'G2': 11, 'G3': 7}, {another element}, â€¦ ]

     >>> student_health_list('student-mat.csv', -3)
